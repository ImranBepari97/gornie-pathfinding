# Pathfinding for GORN
Allows Gorn enemies to use pathfinding to reach the player instead of blindly walking in a straight line towards them!

This project was created to improve the AI pathfinding capabilities of the enemies in GORN. Previously, enemies would simply move in a straight line towards the player.
The issue with this, is that when the modding community wants to add custom maps and levels to the game, the enemies won't be able to function.

This project builds a modification to the game that overrides their behaviours, to create an intelligent path to the player, rather than walk in a straight line.
